# Autonomous-vehicles-using-IoT-enabled-AI-technologies
# Introduction 
In this project, we aspire to develop a city that relies on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to deal with self-driving vehicles and their importance to humans and provide the best solutions with easy effort and reduce the financial cost through the development of sensors. And linking them with self-driving vehicles to facilitate transportation, choose the best roads, and avoid congestion and dangerous problems.

# Problem Definition
Various methodological techniques have been developed to discover and predict the best paths for autonomous vehicles through advanced sensor processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence algorithms. The purpose of this project is to first investigate basic smart algorithms that are being applied to discover the best approaches for autonomous and autonomous vehicles. Then, using advanced technologies to accurately detect traffic congestion, choose the appropriate road, and have less time while driving. Although many survey articles have been written to address this issue, according to our limited knowledge, none of them have built a hybrid system with cameras and sensors to study the road and provide the best solutions. There is a recent investigative article to detect and predict accidents before they happen, but that study indicated that there are still many improvements required in this area. Accordingly, in this project, we will also develop an integrated e-sharing technology for predicting best methods and incidents before they happen that supports AI and the Internet of Things. 


# carla 
is Open-source simulator for autonomous driving research [https://carla.org/]. CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites, environmental conditions, full control of all static and dynamic actors, maps generation and much more.

# Tools and Technologies
* Carla simulation tool
The Carla Simulator was developed to support developers to design and verify autonomous driving systems. The Carla platform provides some open-source protocols to support the development and improvement of systems for autonomous driving and also provides a set of sensors and environmental conditions and fully controls them freely.
* Unreal Engine (UE4)
is a complete suite of creation tools for game development, architectural and automotive
visualization, live event production, training and simulation, and other real-time applications.

# Graphical User Interface Description
In this part, we will show some pictures of when the CARLA simulator is running and explain the details about it.
